The goal of this analysis is to explore how various features effect consumer search behavior. Above this, you will understand the interplay between a keyword's context and consumers' search behavior.

In reality, keyword contextual ambiguity can result in both higher diversity in ad quality and higher probability of ad irrelevancy.
